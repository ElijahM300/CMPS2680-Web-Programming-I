        With the 2020 season of the Overwatch League coming to a close this weekend for the Grand Finals, I would like to give my 
        predictions on what might happen this weekend between the four remaining teams as they battle it out in Asia. Matches are played
        in a double-elimination format with the winner of a match being first to three maps until the Grand Finals which is first to four.
        Teams that lose are sent to the losers bracket to play for a last shot at the Grand Finals and teams that lose here are eliminated 
        from the tournament. The last team remaining in the winners bracket and the last team remaining in the losers bracket will go up 
        against each other for the Grand Finals where teams are playing to win the championship trophy for their organization and for prize 
        money totaling up to $1,500,000! Based on my predictions below, I believe that the Dragons will win it all because of their strong
        performance this season.
