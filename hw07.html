            Hello everyone! Recently I've been trying to get back into collecting Pokemon cards since<br>
            it's been around 4-5 years when I last was collecting them consistently. The last time I was<br>
            collecting Pokemon cards, it was the X and Y generation of Pokemon so it's been a little since<br> 
            the generation now is Sword and Shield. But before I start expanding my collection again, I<br> 
            decided to take a look back at the cards I have just to see where my personal collection<br> 
            stands as of right now.<br>
            <br>
            Over the past couple of days I've been looking at my collection very closely and researching all<br>
            of the rare cards I have. I have all of my regular basic cards in a white binder, each in their<br> 
            own card sleeve, along with most of my reverse holographic cards. My regular holographic cards and<br> 
            other ultra rare cards like full arts, level X's, and EX's are in their own seperate card holder that's<br> 
            Pokemon themed(If you're unsure on what exactly I mean by those cards, I will provide pictured examples<br> 
            below this post). I didn't think that the cards I have would be worth much but boy was I wrong. One of<br>
            my rare cards is a Charizard Lv. X and also a Blaziken Lv. X that I traded for in 6th grade and when<br> 
            looking up the prices for the Charizard card my jaw dropped when I saw people selling this card I have<br> 
            for up to $100+! Since mine isn't in mint condition it definitely won't be worth as much but it definitely<br> 
            is at least worth around $75. The other cards I have do have some good prices too ranging from $5 to $30<br> 
            but the two mentioned above are the most important in my collection. Looking to the future, hopefully I<br> 
            can get some more cards really soon and pull some really cool and rare cards to increase the value of my<br> 
            collection and to expand it. Wish me luck in the opening of my card packs in the near future!<br>
