                Hello all you gamers! In this post I wanted to talk about some of the games I've been playing recently<br>
                and what my favorite game of all time is and why. So to start, the main games I've been playing recently<br>
                are Dead By Daylight and Overwatch on my PS4 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons on my Switch. I don't play<br>
                Overwatch as often as the other two right now but once the Winter Wonderland event for this year comes out<br>
                I'll definitely be playing it a lot more than I am right now. My main focus right now is Dead By Daylight<br>
                because I'm trying to finish what's called the Rift in this game which is just essentially a battle pass<br>
                like what Fortnite has. The good thing though is that there's only 70 tiers and I'm on tier 39 of the Rift<br> 
                with 25 days left to go so I should be able to complete it. For those of you that don't know what Dead By<br>
                Daylight is, it's an asymmetrical horror game where it's one killer against four survivors and the goal for<br>
                the killer is to, well, kill everyone and for the survivors, you need to repair five generators that power<br>
                up exit gates so that you can escape. I think the game is very fun and cool since you have classic licensed<br>
                killers in this game like Michael Myers or Ghostface and even the Demogorgon from Stranger Things is a killer<br>
                in this game. Moving on to Animal Crossing, winter is now on people's islands and with it comes a lot of new<br>
                DIY recipes for you to make so you can decorate your island with plenty of Christmas stuff. Each day you can<br>
                make a snowman and if you make them right, they'll give you a DIY recipe to craft and a large snowflake which<br>
                is essential for the recipes that snowmen can give you. What's known as Toy Day is on Christmas Eve and you have<br>
                to basically be Santa and deliver toys and gifts to all of your villagers and in return you'll get a special<br>
                item.<br> 
                <br>
                So, now that what I'm playing now is out of the way, I wanted to talk about what my favorite game of all<br>
                time is and why it's my favorite. I've played a numerous amount of games from when I started to play video games<br>
                so picking my favorite was a tough choice but for me, I would have to go with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.<br>
                Simply put, I think this game is one of the best games ever made because for a Mario game, the plot is surprisingly<br>
                dark and very interesting which is a nice change from what you would usually be used to in a Mario game. Also, the<br>
                game is an action/adventure rpg so turn-based battling is the main focus for combat. The world, the characters, and<br>
                how unique and original this game is makes this game a very good time all around and I would highly, HIGHLY, recommend<br>
                this game to anyone who hasn't played it before and trust me, you won't be disappointed with it. Well, that's all for<br>
                this post so thank you for reading this and before I end this post, below you will find trivia for basic video game<br>
                knowledge with five questions so have fun with that and good luck!<br>
