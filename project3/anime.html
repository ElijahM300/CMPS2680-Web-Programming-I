                Hello everyone! Today I wanted to go through some of my favorite anime's that I've watched so far and to tell you<br>
                guys which one is my most favorite out of all of them. To start, the very first anime that I ever really watched<br> 
                was Kaguya Sama: Love is War. The second season came out a while ago and while I still haven't watched it yet, I have<br> 
                watched all of season 1 so let's get into it. Love is War is a really good RomCom anime that never falls short of being<br> 
                able to deliver humor and the characters in this show are also very funny and interesting to watch interact with one<br> 
                another. Overall, this anime has got humor and heart which is why it's one of my favorites. Now, on to the next anime,<br> 
                I would have to say that another favorite of mine is Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. This anime also has a lot of heart<br> 
                and humor and is just an overall great anime with lovable characters and while there's obviuosly not a lot of action,<br> 
                it's what I would consider alomst a slice of life anime that's really laid back and fun to watch. The next anime that<br> 
                I want to discuss as one of my favorite's would probably have to be My Hero Academia. Almost a year ago I started to<br> 
                watch this anime since I wanted to see what all the buzz was about and I was not disappointed. While I haven't necessarily<br> 
                finished all of the anime since I've only watched through half of season 4. I have watched most of it and so many aspects of<br> 
                it are great like the story, the characters, the action and the emotions are all there and make this anime very good in my<br> 
                opinion. Now, on to my favorite anime which will probably always be my favorite, Jojo's Bizzare Adventure. I don't even know<br>
                where to begin with this anime. It's a story that spans over a century where each season just gets better and better and the<br>
                chrarcters in each season are very lovable and memorable. The humor is great and the villains in each season are memorable<br> 
                and great too. I finally watched it earlier this year with my girlfriend since she pushed me to watch it for so long and so<br>
                I finally caved in and was not disappointed and surprisingly it became my favorite anime. If you want to know more about each<br>
                Jojo, I'll have information on them below this post but otherwise that's it for now. Thank you so much for reading and I hope<br>
                you have a good day!
